(parted) rm 2 <-- We will delete the root partition's entry. This will not impact the content of root partition and only partition table is modified. 
Warning: Partition /dev/sda2 is being used. Are you sure you want to continue?
Yes/No? Yes
Error: Partition(s) 2 on /dev/sda have been written, but we have been unable to inform the kernel of the change, probably because
it/they are in use.  As a result, the old partition(s) will remain in use.  You should reboot now before making further changes.
Ignore/Cancel? Ignore  <-- If you reboot your server at this stage then you may end up with a broken node so don't reboot your node at this stage.
(parted) p <-- Print the current partition table
